"Don't practice what you know. Practice what you don't know!"

30 minutes is a typical amount of practice time that people can afford. 

"I like to think of pracicing in thirds"
Practice routine should be divided into 3 areas:
1. Ear Training
2. Technique
3. Repertoire

1. 10 Minutes Ear Training: 
"Predictive ear training" is a good way to start:
Play the 1 and 5 on an instrument and sing the middle note that gives it the quality of a chord: 
- major, minor, sus 2, sus 4, lydian triad (1-#4-5), phrygian triad (1-b2-5)

Pick up the next day where you left off the last day. 
Intervals, chords, melody identification.

2. 10 Minutes Technique
"Practice what you don't know."
Ideas: 
    - 5 positions of major scale.
    - 5 positions of pentatonic scale.
    - Arpeggios. (scale, then arpeggio, then arpeggio 1-5-3-7-5-1, etc. Use a "Freeze" pedal to get a pedal tone)
    - Every major/minor triad really only has 3 fingering positions. Alternates exist, practice connecting them. Shift positions. 
    - Take a key and play the I, IV, V arpeggios over a I chord drone. 

3. Repertoire 
This can be a lot of different things: 
- Learning how to connect chord voicings
- Learning how to solo over a blues
- Learning how to accompany a blues
- Learning how to solo over your favorite songs

Exercise: 
- Play the I, V, ii, V triads over a IVsus2 chord. Lydian sound. 

Come up with new ideas. Learn the neck. 
Practicing scales and arpeggios gives you the facility to know your way around the neck so that ultimately you can turn it into music.
