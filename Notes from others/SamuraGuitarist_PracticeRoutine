5 hour routine, but only 4 hours scheduled so an hour can be used on whatever gets you excited that day. 
Tips: 
    - Keep a practice journal. Record exercises, speed at which you played them. 

30 Minutes Warmup
    - Get a songbook and play music along with something you know. Not too hard. 
    - Something that you enjoy playing. 
    - The point is to get warmed up, but also enjoy it. 
    - Also could be jamming on a chord along with a metronome. 

30 Minutes Technique 
    - This is the stuff that you don't necessarily love, but is important. 
    - Do this stuff early because it could be hard to focus later in the session. 
    - Fast and repeating patterns. As fast as you comfortably play it. Don't stretch it too much. Record exercise and speed in practice journal. 
    - Every once in a while, do it at a speed that is incredibly slow to analyze for efficiency.
    - Could also be done with a musical passage or scale. 

30 Minutes Ear Training 
    - Use an app to train recognition of intervals, chords, phrases, etc. 

30 Minutes Sight Reading
    - Standard notation you've never seen before. Get some books. 

1 Hour Gaining Knowledge 
    - Chord relationships. 
    - Neck studies: 
    - All 7 diatonic arpeggios in one position. Then another position. 
    - Diatonic arpeggios on one string. 
    - Neck knowledge - relationship of chords and scales.
    - The point is to understand the guitar neck better so that when you're out in the world, you don't have to think about all this stuff and you can just play and be creative. 
    - Song learning
    - Play melody of a standard in multiple positions along neck. 
    - Use chords that's aren't necessarily your "go to" voicings. Maybe play all chords in one position. 
    - Incorporate a bass line. 
    - Just look at the song in as many ways as possible so that you can be free to be creative. 
    - "Lifing" - learn somebody else's solo

1 Hour Practical Application 
    - Use what you worked on in the last section and use it in a practical way. Maybe play over a backing track and solo in such a way that it emphasizes what you just practiced.
